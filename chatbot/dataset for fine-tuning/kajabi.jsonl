There are companies out there thatcharge a fortune to do this for you, but the truth is, you can often do it yourself. Thisguide is here to show you how, without breaking the bank.Your Journey Begins: Taking Control of YourCredit\n\nCONTENTSAPPENDIXChapter 12: Empowering\n\nYour Financial Journey\n\n11296\n\n9792\n\n92929394949489909091\n\n11According to Section 60 of the National Credit Act, everyadult person, corporation, or legal entity in South Africahas the right to apply for credit. This means thatwhether you're an individual or a business, you havethe opportunity to access credit facilities, providedyou meet the lender's criteria.Credit is essentially a financial arrangement where a lender provides you withfunds or resources, which you agree to repay over time, often with interest. Itallows you to make purchases or investments that you might not be able toafford upfront. However, managing credit responsibly is key to maintaining ahealthy financial profile.Understanding credit is the first step towards taking control of your financialfuture. In South Africa, credit plays a crucial role in everyday life, from buying ahome to securing a car loan. However, navigating the credit landscape can bechallenging, especially if you're not familiar with how it works.\n\nImagine credit as a bridge that helps you cross from where you arefinancially to where you want to be. Just like any bridge, it needs to be strong andwell-maintained to ensure a safe journey. If you overload it with debt or neglect itsupkeep, it might collapse, leaving you stranded.Consider the story of Thandi, a young entrepreneur who wanted to expand hersmall bakery. She knew she needed a loan to buy new equipment but wasunsure if she could apply. Understanding her rights under the National CreditAct gave her the confidence to approach a bank and successfully secure thecredit she needed to grow her business.\n\nYes, your credit application can be declined. Section 60(2) of the National CreditAct states that a credit application can be declined if it does not align with theprovider’s established risk mitigation and underwriting policy. For instance,having a negative credit score, commonly referred to as blacklisting, will affectyour credit application. A negative credit score indicates that you cannot affordthe credit you want, which is a common reason for application denial.CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO CREDIT INSOUTH AFRICA\n\n1.1 Understanding Credit\n\n1.2 Who Can Apply for Credit inSouth Africa?1.3 Can My Credit Application Be Declined?\n\n12Understanding these basics is crucial as you begin yourjourney to improve your credit. In the following chapters,we'll delve deeper into how you can manage youraccounts, deal with debt collectors, and ultimatelyrepair your credit to achieve financial freedom.On the other hand, a poor credit record might mean you need towork harder to prove your reliability to lenders.Think of your credit record as a report card for your financial behaviour. Just likein school, where good grades can lead to scholarships and opportunities, a goodcredit record can lead to better loan terms and financial opportunities.Your credit record, often referred to as a credit profile, is a detailed account ofyour credit history. It includes personal information, details of your creditaccounts, and your payment history. This record is used by lenders to assess yourcreditworthiness when you apply for credit. A positive credit record can opendoors to better credit terms, while a negative record can limit your options.If you do not have a credit score, it is important to note that you will not haveone until you start borrowing and repaying credit. The National Credit Act makesit illegal for credit providers to deny you a credit application solely because youdo not have a credit score. Section 70(2)(h) of the Act bars credit bureaus fromdeducing a negative listing or determining your creditworthiness based on alack of a credit score.Effectively managing your accounts is a crucial step in maintaining a healthycredit profile. Understanding which accounts to prioritise and the implicationsof financial commitments can make a significant difference inyour credit journey."}]}

This willimpact your credit report and may not be reflected on the credit record ofthe person you stood surety for.\n\nSection 125 of the National Credit Act allows consumers to cancel their creditagreements at any time, as long as they settle the full outstanding debt.

If you choose not to withdraw it,the motor vehicle will be sold, and your accountwill be adjusted based on the proceeds of thesale, minus any reasonable costs incurred by thecredit provider.Review the Notice from Your Bank: Carefully read the notice from your bank tounderstand the specifics of your default and any recommended actions.Contact the Bank Promptly: Reach out to your bank to discuss your situation andexplore potential solutions.Consider Professional Assistance: Engage a debt counsellor or relevant authorityto help negotiate a repayment plan or resolve disputes.Establish a Repayment Plan: Work with the bank or a third party to create afeasible plan to catch up on your missed payments.Additionally, you cannot reinstate the agreement if the credit provider hasformally cancelled it after giving you at least ten business days’ notice.\n\nIn such cases, you will still be responsible for theremaining balance, and the credit provider mayrequire you to enter into a repayment plan toaddress the shortfall.If you fail to notify the credit provider of your intent to surrender the vehiclevoluntarily, repossession will require court action. This usually results in the vehiclebeing auctioned off to cover the debt, but often the auction proceeds fall short ofthe full amount owed.However, reinstating the credit agreement is not possible if the vehicle has alreadybeen sold due to an attachment order or if you have voluntarily surrendered it.\n\nNB: Section 129(3) of the National CreditAct allows you to reinstate the credit agreementfor the motor vehicle at any time before the creditprovider officially cancels it. To do so, you must payall overdue amounts, along with any defaultcharges and reasonable enforcement costsincurred up to the point of reinstatement.\n\n34 35CHAPTER 5: LEGAL ASPECTS OF CREDIT\n\nJohan was surprised to find a judgement on hiscredit report. He had not been aware of any courtcase against him. After seeking legal advice, Johandiscovered that he had not been properly notifiedof the court proceedings. By proving this, he suc-cessfully applied for rescission of the judgement,which led to its removal from his credit report.\n\nThe in duplum rule, established in common law, dictates thatinterest accrual halts once it equals the unpaid principal.A Magistrate Court judgement against you canseverely impact your credit score. If a creditortakes you to court and the court rules in theirfavour, this judgement will be recorded on yourcredit report, signalling to other lenders that youhave an unpaid debt.Understanding the legal aspects of credit can help you navigate complex situationsand protect your rights. This chapter covers various legal listings and rules, such asjudgements, notices, and specific legal principles like the in duplum rule, and how tomanage or remove them.\n\nExample: Peter's Awareness of the In Duplum Rule Peter wasnegotiating a settlement for an old debt and used the in duplumrule to ensure he wasn’t overcharged. This saved him from payingexcessive interest and additional charges.\n\nIf you were not aware of a judgement issued against you, you have the right toapply for rescission. This involves submitting an application to the court thatissued the judgement, often requiring proof that you were not notified properlyor that there was an error in the process.Section 103(5) of the National Credit Act expands on this by specifying that inter-est and additional charges—such as initiation fees, service fees, credit insurance,default administration fees, and collection costs—must not exceed the remain-ing balance of the principal debt at the point of default.\n\nBefore settling an account, ensure that the in duplum rule specified in theNational Credit Act has not been violated. Simply put, if you fall behind onpayments, you should not be required to repay more than double the originalborrowed amount, regardless of any added interest or fees.\n\n5.2 The In Duplum Rule5.1 Magistrate CourtJudgement Listing\n\n5.3 What If I Didn’t Know a JudgementWas Issued Against Me?Example: Johan's JudgementImportant Notes:\n\n36 375.4 Notice ListingsNotice listings are recorded when you have been given notice of legal action, such as apending court case or a notice of default.

This affidavit includes statements confirming thatthe applicant/defendant has settled the claim made bythe respondent/plaintiff and that the respondent/plaintiff agrees to the judgement beingrescinded.\n\nCertain courts might reject aconsent in letter form and instead requirethe respondent/plaintiff to sign a consentnotice in the form of an affidavit. Forexample, the Johannesburg MagistrateCourt typically mandates that the consentnotice be submitted as an affidavit.NB: Some courts may insist on the originalconsent notice, while others might acceptjust a copy. To avoid any issues, it's best toprovide the court with original documentswhenever possible.\n\nNB: If the consent isn't provided in theformat required by the court, your rescissionapplication could be rejected, causing delaysin the rescission process.This document is commonly known as a \"Section 36(2) notice\" and is typicallysigned by the respondent/plaintiff or their legal representatives.\n\n10.5.3 What if the JudgementInvolves Both Me and Another Party?10.5.4 Notice of Consent\n\n70 7110.5.5 Draft Court Order\n\n10.5.6 Commissioning Your Documentation\n\n10.5.7 How to Serve and File Your RescissionApplication\n\n10.5.10 Court Dress Code and BehaviorGuidelines10.5.9 Attending Court forYour Rescission Application\n\nOnce you’ve assembled all your documents, the next step is to check if therespondent or plaintiff's consent notice includes a service waiver.An oath commissioner has the authority to administer an oath and is the personbefore whom the applicant/defendant must sign the founding affidavit.The next step is to create the draft court order, a preliminary document that becomesofficial once the judgement is rescinded. This draft is finalised when it is signed byeither the Magistrate who nullifies the judgement or by the clerk of the relevant court.\n\nNB: When you go to court to have the judgement rescinded, it's crucial to bring a copyof the draft court order with you. This is the document you’ll need to submit to thecredit bureaus to ensure the judgement is removed from your credit records.\n\nYour judgement will be overturned on thedate assigned by the court clerk whenyou file your application.\n\nMake sure to dress appropriately for your court appearance, as a magistrate mightrefuse to hear your rescission application if your attire is unsuitable. Men shouldwear a jacket and tie, while women should also dress conservatively and neatly.If service is waived, you can skip the step of delivering the rescission applicationdirectly to them. Instead, all you need to do is hand over your rescission applicationto the court clerk.\n\nThis act of submitting your paperwork is known as \"filing your application\" with thecourt.\n\nNB: It’s a smart move to bring proof of your identification when you appear in court.Without it, the court might not consider your rescission application.You'll need to be present in court on the date assigned bythe clerk for your rescission application hearing.10.5.8 When Will My Judgment BeOverturned (Rescinded)?\n\n7310.5.11 How to Remove a Judgment ListingAfter Rescission 10.6 Removing a High CourtJudgment Listing\n\nNB: Make sure to send the rescission court order to ITC, Experian, and XDS to ensurethe judgement is removed from all credit records. Don't assume the listing appearson just one bureau’s report—judgments can show up across multiple creditbureaus.Send the issued court order to the credit bureaus to notify them that the judgementhas been rescinded. Once they receive the order, they have 20 business days toupdate your credit record and remove the judgement listing.\n\nIf you can demonstrate a legitimate defence against the respondent's claim andprovide valid reasons for your payment default, you may have strong grounds toseek a judgement rescission.NB: In a Magistrate Court, you can have a judgement rescinded if you secure therespondent's or plaintiff's consent. However, in the High Court, simply having therespondent's or plaintiff's agreement is not sufficient grounds for rescinding thejudgement.High Court judgments can only be overturned in specific situations, so be mind-ful of this when working to remove them from your credit record. For expert helpand a thorough evaluation of your case, reach out to Credit Repair Pro.\n\n10.6.1 Proving a Bona Fide Defense andJustifying Default for Judgement RescissionExamples of When a High Court Judgment Can Be Rescinded:\n\n74 7510.6.3 Special CircumstancesKnown to the JudgementCreditor Before the Judgment10.6.2 Judgment Granted or Sought in ErrorA High Court judgement may be overturned if it's proven that it was sought orgranted by mistake.NB: Failing to provide a valid defence against the judgement creditor's claimcan lead to the High Court rejecting your rescission request. For instance, inLazarus v Nedcor Bank and Lazarus v ABSA Bank 1999(2)SA782 (W), thecourt dismissed the rescission applications despite the applicants havingconsent letters from the judgement creditors."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"assistant","content":"\n\nIf you missed payments and reached out to the respondent ortheir lawyers to explain your unique situation, and they assuredyou that legal proceedings would be postponed or that ajudgement wouldn't be issued due to your circumstances, youmight have grounds to challenge the judgement.For example, if you had established a payment plan with the respondent or theirlegal representatives before the judgement was issued and followed through withthe arrangement, you could have grounds for rescission. This agreement doesn’tneed to be written; a verbal arrangement can also be valid.You need to ask your debt counsellor for a clearance certificate. Once you havethis certificate, send it to the credit bureau to update your credit record andremove the indication that you were under debt counselling.NB: The list above is not comprehensive. For personalised advice on whetheryour High Court judgement can be successfully rescinded and removed fromyour credit record, it's highly recommended that you reach out to CreditFixfor expert guidance and support.For example, if the judgement involves property you once owned and sold, and therespondent was aware of the sale before the judgement was finalised, you couldargue that they should not have proceeded with the judgement.\n\n10.7 Removing a Debt Counselling Notification\n\n76 77Once you’ve fully paid off your administrationorder—covering both your debts and theadministrator’s fees—you can request thecourt that issued the order to rescind it. Afterthe court grants the rescission, make sure tosend the court order to the credit bureaus tohave the administration order removed fromyour credit report.\n\nNB: Clearing your administration order doesn’tautomatically remove the listing from yourcredit record. After settling the order, youneed to request a “section 74U certificate”from your administrator to proceed withrescinding the order. This certificate, issuedunder the Magistrates’ Court Act, confirmsthat all debts covered by the administrationorder have been fully paid.Before the data retention period for your administration order listing expires, youcan have an administration order rescinded and removed from your credit recordunder these circumstances:\n\nNB: To demonstrate to the court that your financial situation has improved,compare your current monthly income with your monthly expenses. Ensureyou have a surplus that exceeds the amount originally ordered for payment toyour administrator.\n\nIf you get a summons for a debt youcan’t afford to pay, don’t just ignore it(refer to paragraph 29.1 for details onaccounts you’re not legally required tosettle). The summons will specify thenumber of days you have to respond.If your financial situation has improved since you were placed under administration,you can apply to rescind the administration order. This application is made undersection 74Q of the Magistrates’ Court Act.10.8 Removing an Administration Order Listing 10.8.2 Rescind Your Administration Orderwith Improved Financial Circumstances\n\n10.8.1 Rescind and Remove AdministrationOrders with Full Debt Payment\n\n10.9 Handling aPayment Demandor Summons\n\n78 79NB: If you are required by law to pay the debt, you should either arrange tosettle the amount with the creditor or seek legal advice if necessary. If thecreditor rejects your proposed payment plan, you need to notify the court ofyour intention to defend yourself. Subsequently, you will need to file a noticeof intention to defend.\n\nIf you receive a summons for a debt that has already been prescribed, youshould contest the claim because the debt is indeed time-barred. Failing todo so could result in a judgement against you, as the court might mistakenlybelieve the claim is still valid. However, if you choose to settle a debt thathas been prescribed, you may do so ethically. You can make payments on aprescribed debt without altering the prescription period,provided you mark these payments as \"withoutprejudice\" and avoid admittingliability.\n\nExample: Tracey's Adverse ListingTracey discovered an adverse listing on her credit report due to a misunderstand-ing with a service provider. She contacted the provider, clarified the situation, andsettled the outstanding amount. The provider agreed to update her credit record,removing the adverse listing and restoring her creditworthiness.Other negative listings, such as adverse listings or trace alerts, can also affect yourcredit. Understanding the duration these listings remain on your record andtaking steps to address them can help improve your credit profile.\n\nGather Evidence: Collect all relevantdocuments that prove the listing isincorrect (e.g., payment receipts,court orders).Example: Musa's Incorrect ListingMusa noticed a default listed on hiscredit report that he knew was incorrect.He contacted the credit bureau andprovided proof that the debt had beensettled years ago. After reviewing hisevidence, the bureau removed theincorrect listing, which improved Musa’scredit score significantly.Sometimes, negative listings appear on your credit record by mistake. It is essen-tial to act quickly to dispute any inaccuracies and ensure they are removed fromyour record.Identify the Listing: Review your credit record to identify anyadverse listings or trace alerts.Contact the Creditor: Reach out to the creditor or service providerto resolve the issue and settle any outstanding amounts.Request an Update: Ask the creditor to update your credit recordonce the issue is resolved.Monitor Your Credit Record: Regularly check your credit record toensure the negative listing has been removed or updated.\n\n10.10 Removing Other Negative Listings10.11 Handling Incorrect ListingsSteps to Remove Other Negative Listings:\n\nSteps to Dispute Incorrect Listings:\n\n80 81After successfully removing several negative listings fromher credit report, Lerato decided to take proactive steps toprevent future issues.

Creditors may accept this to avoid the riskof receiving nothing.\n\nTipsOffer a Lump Sum: Creditors are often more willing tosettle if you can pay a lump sum upfront.Get It in Writing: Always get the settlement agreementin writing before making any payments.TipsHighlight Your Payment History: If you’ve been a good customer in the past, usethis to your advantage.Mention Competitors: If other creditors have offered better terms, mention this asleverage in your negotiation.\n\n86 8711.4.2 Waiving Late Fees11.4.1 Reducing Interest Rates\n\n11.4.4 Requesting a PaymentPlan\n\n11.5 Following Up After Negotiation11.4.3 Proposing a Debt Settlement\n\n\"Hi, this is [Your Name], and I’m calling about my account [Account Number] with[Creditor Name].
